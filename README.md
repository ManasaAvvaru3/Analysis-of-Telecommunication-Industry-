Application Usage
Session Duration: User involvement levels and preferences for particular applications are revealed by the average length of data sessions.
Total Download (DL) and Upload (UL) Data: Understanding user data consumption trends and possible network resource needs can be gained by analyzing the total amount of data uploaded and downloaded.
Number of xDR Sessions: This indicator shows how frequently users start data sessions, which sheds light on general trends in data usage.
Total Data Volume (Bytes): This measure gives a thorough picture of user data usage by representing the total amount of data used throughout each session.

Univariate Analysis
Variable Description: The analysis gives a clear grasp of the data structure by describing each variable and the data type that goes with it.
Basic Metrics: For every variable, the analysis computes fundamental metrics including mean, median, and standard deviation, offering information about the distribution of the data.
Dispersion Parameters: By calculating dispersion parameters for every quantitative variable, the research sheds light on the variability and spread of the data.
Graphical Analysis: To visualize the data distribution and spot possible outliers, the analysis makes use of the proper plotting options for every variable.

Bivariate Analysis
Google vs. Total Data: The investigation looks for any possible links between the amount of data consumed overall and Google usage.
Email vs. Total Data: In order to find any possible correlations, the analysis investigates the relationship between email usage and overall data consumption.
Social Media vs. Total Data: The investigation looks for any possible links between the use of social media and overall data consumption.
YouTube vs. Total Data: In order to find any possible links, the analysis investigates the relationship between YouTube usage and overall data consumption.

Identifying Key Contributors
Top Engaged Users per Application
Each program's top ten engaged users are determined by the analysis, which also offers insights on engagement patterns unique to each application.
Top 10 Engaged Users
Based on interaction indicators, the research highlights the most active users by identifying the top 10.
Visualizing Engagemen
The analysis provides a clear insight of user activity by visualizing engagement trends and patterns using the appropriate charts.

Analyzing User Experience Metrics
Understanding the distribution and connections between user experience metrics and handset kinds is the goal of the analysis. This data can be used to optimize network performance for various user categories and spot possible areas for improvement.
Calculating the average TCP retransmission rate per customer offers information about network stability and possible problems for various user groups.
By calculating the average RTT per customer, possible latency problems and their effects on the user experience across different device kinds are highlighted.
By examining the average throughput per customer, possible bottlenecks and differences in data transfer rates among various user segments are identified.

User Engagement Analysis
Because it reflects the amount of involvement and activity consumers have with telecommunications services, user engagement is a critical component of customer satisfaction. Patterns of user interaction and their connection to user experience are examined in this investigation.
Call logs, data usage statistics, and app usage trends are just a few of the sources from which user interaction data is gathered.
Important engagement indicators are established, including social media activity, data usage, call duration, and frequency of app usage.
Different user engagement profiles are identified by grouping users according to their levels of engagement using the k-means clustering technique.

Predicting Customer Satisfaction
Using measurements for user involvement and experience, a regression model is created to forecast consumer happiness. By using this model, possible problems with satisfaction can be found and proactively fixed.
The features of the data and the required prediction accuracy are taken into consideration while selecting an appropriate regression model.
Through training on past data, the chosen model is able to understand the connections among user satisfaction, experience, and engagement.
To evaluate the trained model's performance and make sure it can reliably forecast customer pleasure, it is tested on unseen data.

Customer Segmentation Based on Satisfaction
Customers are divided into categories according to their satisfaction ratings using the k-means clustering technique. Personalized service offerings and focused marketing strategies are made possible by this segmentation.
Customers with high satisfaction ratings, which indicate a favorable overall experience with the telecommunications services, are represented by this cluster.
Customers in this cluster had moderate satisfaction ratings, indicating a mixed experience with room for improvement.
Customers with poor satisfaction ratings make up this cluster, which draws attention to possible problems and areas that need urgent care.
